# Font-Design

With the increasing amount of screen time in our daily lives, reading can become a challenge, particularly in low-light conditions. A specialized font that reduces cognitive load is essential to enhance reading speed and comprehension. By focusing on consistent stroke widths and simplified shapes, this font minimizes eye strain, while open counters in letters like 'o', 'e', and 'a' ensure clarity. The design also addresses common issues like character confusion—making similar characters such as 'i', 'l', '1', or 'O', '0' easily distinguishable. Slightly increased letter spacing and precise kerning prevent crowding, making individual characters more discernible. Soft, rounded edges minimize glare, and the font’s semi-bold weight ensures it remains readable even in dim environments. With a large x-height and improved line spacing, this font enhances readability at smaller sizes, providing an accessible and comfortable reading experience for all users, especially under challenging conditions.
